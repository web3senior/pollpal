## Desc
PollPal is a decentralized platform for creating and participating in community-driven polls. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures secure, transparent, and fair voting. To further empower our community and support project growth, PollPal integrates the $G token from the GoodDollar ecosystem. We will utilize $G tokens as a form of grant distribution to reward active participants, poll creators, and contribute to the ongoing development of the platform. This aligns with GoodDollar's vision of fostering a 'trickle-up' value structure, directly benefiting those who contribute to and utilize PollPal. By leveraging the $G token, we aim to incentivize community participation, promote decentralized governance, and build a sustainable platform for collective decision-making.


**PollPal** is a decentralized, web3-based platform built on the LUKSO blockchain. It empowers users to create and share polls with the public or a specific group of friends. By leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, PollPal ensures that votes are secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof.

## Features
- Accessibility: Users can vote from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need for physical polling places or specific voting times.

- Security: Blockchain ensures that votes are tamper-proof and verifiable, enhancing trust in the voting process.

- Transparency: The decentralized nature of the platform provides transparency into the voting process, allowing users to verify the accuracy of results.
