## üî¥ Problem
- Centralized Voting Systems: Traditional voting systems are often centralized, relying on government or third-party organizations to manage the voting process. This can lead to several issues, including:

- Vulnerability to Manipulation: Centralized systems are more susceptible to manipulation, such as voter fraud, hacking, or interference by powerful individuals or groups.

- Limited Accessibility: Voting locations and times may be restricted, making it difficult for certain individuals, such as those in rural areas, the elderly, or people with disabilities, to participate.

- Lack of Trust: The centralized nature of voting systems can erode public trust, as concerns arise about the fairness and transparency of the process.

These challenges can undermine the democratic process and disenfranchise voters, leading to a decline in civic participation.

### üü¢ Solution
PollPal is a decentralized, web3-based platform that aims to address these limitations by providing a more accessible and secure voting experience. By leveraging blockchain technology, PollPal offers the following benefits:

üó≥Ô∏è **Shareability:**

(Optional) Implement a token-based reward system to incentivize participation and community growth.
